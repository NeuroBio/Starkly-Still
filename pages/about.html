				<h1>You</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					In this era, where the <i>surely</i> beneficent corporate dictators of our universe
					collect and sell wild amounts of your personal data with zero transparency,
					I'm making a little stand:
					No, I don't track you.
					No, I don't want your data.
					Yes, my work is legitimately free-to-read without tacitly selling your data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if you bookmark something, it's stored in local storage on your device, which you control.
					I get no notifications about it.
					I don't store the numbers anywhere else.
					I'm not running stats on it.
					
				</p>
				<p>
					In case you want a quick listing of what you have in local storage from this site, here it is:

				<h1>Me</h1>
				<hr>
				<ul>
					<li>
						PhD in "Computational Biology" as I call it.
						In truth, it was 2/3 cell biology and neuroscience,
						1/3 bird song evolution using meta-analysis
						and an agent-based model I translated from MatLab to R then C# and greatly extended.
					</li>
					<li>
						Actual profession: Senior Software Engineer.  I primarily use javascript/typescript these days.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hobbyist writer of course.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hobbyist illustrator /  graphic novelist.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hobbyist musician.  Though I ain't touched that viola in over a decade,
						I had a scholarship to play in my college's orchestra.
					</li>
					<li>
						I have 2 cat overlords.
						Dusky is a wicked intelligent void with a white locket (11 years old).
						Star is a torbie with fewer brain cells than a potato (1 year old).
						They are both 6.5lbs.  They both have huge eyes.
						Star wants senpai to notice her.
						Dusky wants to mash the intruding potato out of existence.
					</li>
