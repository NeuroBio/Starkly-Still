Errek trapsed into the hunter’s barracks planning the conversation.  His evidence.  His argument.  Seeking flaws in them.  He paused at the den chamber.  Seeing the perfectly good, empty wall slots, he rethought even trying.

What would he gain from insisting that Kordi should be his hunting partner?  At best, she would neutrally dismiss him.  At worst, she might turn the others against him out of spite.  Then, he would have to hunt alone.

Maybe that was for the best though.  If he was alone, no one would be watching him.  No one could report his eccentricities to the royals.  He could accept that fate without irritating Kordi.

But she was his only true equal.  Not just in rank but in position.  They understood one another.  No one else could offer him that.  And only he could return the favor for her.  His will solidified.  A chance at that connection was worth the risks.

Scanning the den honeycomb, he found Kordi’s slot near the floor in the far-right edge.  He crouched by it.  Tapped her shoulder.  She wriggled away with a groan then stretched.  He whispered, “You awake?”

“I don’t want to be.  What?”

“I want to be your hunting partner.”  So much for elegantly easing into it.

“No.”  She rolled her back to him.

Well.  There was her answer.  Errek swallowed.  “Look, I know I’m not up to your level yet, but—”

“You’re not going to get there.”

“Am I really that much worse than the other hunters?”

She clicked her tongue, considering it.  “Yeah.  You are.”

“Why?”

A sigh.  She rolled to face him.  “You tell me, Errek.”

“I thought I did well.  That’s why I’m asking you.”

“You have no idea at all?”  Her stare burned into him.

Time to do what Entorani told him not to.  “Fine.  My leg’s off.  But it didn’t affect our hunt.”

“Except for when you were ‘looking for landmarks.’”

He cringed.  “I’m faster than you when I’m not carrying anything.”

Suddenly, he was skidding on his back.  His shoulders pinned to the floor.  Kordi perched boredly above him.  “What’s this?  The twelfth—?”

He knocked her aside.  Slammed her onto her belly.  Rolled on top.  Teeth to her neck.  Pulling back, his fangs scraped across her skin.  “I learn faster than you give me credit for.”  He sat next to her.  Crossed his arms.  Refused to look at her.  “I’m not asking because I think I’ll be a great hunter.  I’m asking because I understand you.  I get you.  You get me.  They won’t.”

“So… you want me to risk working with a weak hunter, for what?  Conversation?”

“If that didn’t mean something to you, you’d be ripping me apart right now.”

“What’s your point?”

“I’ll get good enough that I’m not a risk.  <i>Guaranteed</i>.”

“Or, we talk at the nest.  You can hunt with someone more on your level.”

“You mean a typical hunter?  One that will turn on me after my first mistake.  Make it so the others avoid me except to take advantage of me.  You’ll still talk to me when I’m the target?  When my weakness stops being my leg and becomes exhaustion from fending them off constantly?!”

“At least you get how it works…”

“Kordi, please.  I’m not asking for this because I’m afraid of them.  If they turn on me, I’ll never have a good hunt again, but I’ll hold out until I make knight.  Whatever happens here and now: it’s temporary.  Meaningless.  But I really want to spend more time with you.”

“You’re a <i>really</i> bad hunter, Errek.  And I’m not talking about your leg.”

“Yeah.  I know.”  He took a deep breath.  “But I’m going be a <i>damn</i> good knight.”

“Maybe… I saw what you did with that worker.”

“His name’s Ru.  He’s going to be a hunter soon.”

“I know.”

“And it’s stupid that those idiots are pushing him around!  They shouldn’t be allowed to do that.   It makes <i>them</i> look pathetic.  Pathetic that they think attacking a worker is good sport.”

“You’re right about one thing.”

“What’s that?”

“The other hunters won’t get you.”  She rubbed her face.  Huffed.   “Okay, come on.”  She crawled back into her den.  He sat there staring.  She gave a huffier huff.  “If you want to hunt with me, you need to wake up with me.”

“F-for real?  You’ll partner with me?”

She shrugged.  “The one thing you have going for you is you’re interesting.  And, like you said, this is temporary.  If you make a fool of me, it won’t matter once I reach knight.”

He frowned.  “<i>Thanks.</i>”

“Just being honest.”

He crawled into her den and curled around her.  “I won’t make a fool of you.  I won’t be a risk.  I’ll keep up.”

“Don’t worry about it.  I’ll kill you if you’re a problem.”  She stretched.  “Sleep well.”

Shaking his head, “You too.”

He did sleep well.  Perhaps too well.  A gut punch woke him the next evening.

Kordi kept pummeling until he grabbed her wrist and hissed at her.  Cackling, she shoved him back and slithered out of the den.  She reached the main chamber by the time he was on his feet.  At least he was ready when her casual teasing ended with “Race you.”

They dashed up the spiral.  Errek had a lead until they reached the wall.  Kordi easily beat him to the pit edge.  A mad scramble to catch up.  Somehow, he bolted past her.  Realized she had stopped running.  Skidded to a stop.  Confused, he looked back at her.  Then across the pit.  The queen stood by the cage.

He back peddled to Kordi’s side.  “Since when does the queen show up before mealtime?”

“Don’t question it.  Hang back until she’s done.”

Azehralia circled the cage with Demeko, checking one viewing slat after another.  Rotero hung back, keeping an eye on the exit tunnel.  Eventually, Serana crawled up the wall to join them.  Azehralia waved the knights closer to discuss something.

Meanwhile, another pair of hunters, Lenox and Anvie, joined Errek and Kordi.  The new pair whispered to each other, but Errek caught the words, “about damn time,” “this long,” and “starving.”  Azehralia concluded her business and descended the pit with Rotero.

A tug at Errek’s sleeve.  “Come on.”  Kordi’s voice was unusually quiet.  As they walked to the cage, Errek noted that the other hunters hung back.  Waiting.  Why?  Kordi said, “Evening, Knight Demeko.”

Errek mumbled the same greeting, avoiding eye contact.  He bumped into something.  Demeko’s arm blocked their passage.  “Return to the barracks.  We have enough offerings.”

Kordi furrowed her brow.  “We have enough…?  Is initiation <i>tonight</i>?”  A note of discomfort wove through the last word.

“Tomorrow.”  Serana joined the group.  “It gives the stragglers a night to get back.  The queen prefers to have the entire family present.”

Kordi considered that.  “So, we can go out, as long as we’re back before sunset, right?  I’m sure there’s other resources we need.”

“No.”  Demeko pointed at the pit.  “Return to the barracks.”

“But…”

Errek looked back.  Lenox and Anvie were already halfway down the spiral.  Clearly, this was standard protocol.  No point in arguing.  He put his hand on Kordi’s shoulder.  “Come on.  We’ll find something else to do.”

“S-sure.”

He had to pull her wrist before she drifted after him.

Behind them, Serana asked, “Are you going to tell the prince, or is it my problem?”

A sigh from Demeko.  “Best I take care of it.”

Their tones irritated Errek.  He returned his focus to Kordi.  “So, what do we do when we can’t go out?”

“Nothing.”  Toneless.

“You really wanted to hunt, huh?”

A shrug.  She climbed down the pit wall silently.

“Well, we can still talk, right?”

“Sure.”

As they walked down the spiral, Errek anxiously spat out questions and suggestions.  Kordi dismissed them all.  He kept a step ahead of her so she had to look at him.  Except, when they made eye contact, it seemed like she was somewhere else.  He stopped.  She wandered passed him.

“Kordi, I…”  He shook his head.  “Are you really this upset about staying in?”

She turned on her heels, glaring at him.  “I thought you said you got me.”
 
“Sure…”  Rubbing his neck.  “I didn’t say I was a mind reader though.”

She scoffed.

He threw his hands to his sides.  “You’re upset.  I don’t know why.  I want to help.  Work with me.”

She stepped into his space.  “What happens after initiation?”

His first thought was <i>we go hunting again</i>.  Clearly not the right answer.  What then?  “You have to decide who to listen to.  The queen or the princess… but you said you’d figured that out already.”

“And what do you think the answer was?”

Well, he would always pick his royal over the queen.  Projecting that truth onto Kordi might be the wrong answer though.  But lying about it also felt off.  “Princess Vaeilentha?”

“Of course!”

“So… Why is that bad?  It’ll help the family.  You’ll be well fed.  You’ll ascend faster.  The queen won’t—”

“That’s the point!  I don’t want to ascend faster!”

“Why the hell not?”

“Why are you so stupid!?”  Kordi drowned a frustrated scream in her palms.  “Have you noticed anything missing from our ranks?”

Errek bit down on the word “no” and waited for her to clarify.

“What would a prince ascend to?”

“A king?”  Errek shrugged.  “Okay, so, we don’t have one.  What’s your point?”

“They aren’t a thing!  Princes are sacrificed to start the next family.  The faster I ascend, the sooner it’s over for me.  I don’t want to die, Errek!”

“I-I don’t want you to die either…”  Suddenly, he was grateful Entorani had failed.

Kordi thumped her back into the wall, swallowing an anxious giggle.  “You know what the worst part is?  Ilen says I’ll <i>want</i> it.  That I’m only afraid, because I’m not a prince yet.  Once reach it, I’ll want to die for her.  And that’s supposed to be a <i>good</i> thing.”  She crossed her arms.  “So yeah, I’m upset.  And, no, there’s nothing you can do about it.”

“I can be here for you.”

“Great.  Helpful.”   She rolled her shoulders.  “I think what I really want is to be alone.”  She looked to the queen’s balcony.  “No.  I want to be with Ilen.  I’ll forget about it once I’m with her.”

“So… You want to wait for her?”

“Yeah…”  She stared expectantly across the pit.

He had no idea what to say.  No idea how to make this better.

Stepping further from him,  “I want to wait <i>alone</i>.”

“Okay.  Sure.”  Errek took one step down the spiral.  He felt distant.  Death’s implications were still rolling through him.  He had never considered it before.  It was a trifle for the food to deal with.  Not something that affected the family.  Not the ones he cared about.  The revelation that death mattered held weight.  But it was too foreign to comprehend.  <i>It was bad</i>.  That was as far as he got with it.  He hesitated.  “I’ll see you at sunrise?”

“Sure.”
