Torani tripped over a stray raised root in the darkness.  He caught himself, but only barely.  Walking all night after a week of hiding in his cramped den was murder on his legs.  What he would have given for working wings.  It would have been so much easier to find the spot if he could fly.  Panting, he leaned against a tree.  A break.  Just a short—

“I’ve waited long enough, Torani.”

“I know, Ilen.  It’s just… just…”  He pointed weakly ahead.  More trees.  Identical to the one he leaned on.  Identical to the forest behind him.  Her judgement filled the silence.  He pushed away from his resting spot and trudged forward.  A light beam panned through the scrub, momentarily blinding Torani.  “That!  See that!  I told you!”

Stumbling faster.  Crunching leaves turned to hard asphalt underfoot.  He skidded to a stop and back peddled off the road.  That long, black expanse wended for miles in either direction.  “This.  Everything you need, we can get here.”

Directly to his right.  “Is this a joke?”  Torani turned to face her, but only saw air.  “There’s nothing here!”  She was above him.  In the trees.  It was unfair that she could fly.

“Zehra’s family won’t come here.  It’s off-limits.  Food drives by regularly.  Cars are filled with resources.  We’re close enough to the city to benefit from it, but far enough away to be safe.  It’s everything you need.”

“And where exactly am I going to build <i>the nest</i>, Torani?  In the dirt?  Does that sound safe to you?”

“The cars are made of metal.  We can—”

“Dig a little hole that will collapse on us?  Pass.  What’s your next idea?”

“But… It’s… This…”  He scanned the canopy for her.  Her voice sounded so close to him.  She had to be—

“NEXT.  IDEA.  TORANI.”  Tree leaves ruffled with her voice.

He approached her.  Head down.  Shoulders sunk.  Wings clenched as tightly as his balled fists.  “This was my idea.  My <i>only</i> idea.”

The entire tree shook with Vaeilentha’s bitter laughter.  “So.  You’ve failed me.  AGAIN.”  Her robust form dropped from the branches.  Wait, her body was supposed to be thinner.  Shorter.  Her hair should have been longer.  It was too blonde.  She was wingless.

“Se-Ser—?”

The body hosting Vaeilentha’s voice jabbed a finger at Torani’s chest.  “To think, I believed you were capable of something!  I always make that mistake, don’t I?”

He threw his arms around her.  “STOP!  I’ll find someplace else!  Just give me a chance!  I can do this!”

“A lowly grub has no right to touch me.”  Her nails dug into his face like a vice grip, peeling him away.   Blood raced down his cheek.  “Don’t you know?  Your everything will never be enough.”

Her vicious smile widened unnaturally.  The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked.  The crinkles by her eyes cracked.  Dust puffs escaped as each fissure deepened.  Spread.  “I’ve come to realize… it wasn’t a joke on me.  Your failure.  No.  It was a miracle.  Because, now, my children won’t be yours.”

As she laughed, the cracks expanded and met.  Pieces of her cheeks fell away like broken ceramic, leaving behind dark holes that hemorrhaged sand.  She seemed oblivious.  Torani snatched the pieces and tried to put them back in place.  As he pushed, her face shattered.  The damage reached her neck.  Her shoulders.  More pieces falling.  Gushing sand.

“STOP!  JUST STOP LAUGHING.  STOP TALKING!”  He wrapped his hands around her shoulders to hold them together.  He jutted downward.  His weight was too much for her fragile frame.  Her shoulders crumpled in his grasp.  Dragged further down.  His hands clutched for any solid part of her.  Everything he touched fractured, fragmented, disintegrated.  “I CAN’T LOSE YOU AGAIN!”

“Go back below where you belong, Grub.”

He finally looked down.  The sand was swallowing him.  Pulling him under.  Pulling him in.  Crawling up his torso.  Around his arms.  Neck.  Face.  Into his mouth, nose, and eyes.  Covering.  Constricting.  Suffocating.  It buried him.

He thrashed until he broke the surface.  Fought his way free.  Retched out a stomach full of sand between ragged sobs.  Coughing.  Panting.  Scraping his watering eyes clear.  The world was blurry yellow.

Catching his beath.  Spitting the last grit from his mouth.  Warm.  So warm.  A breeze crossed over him, and he shivered.  Feeling around his body.  His clothes were gone.  The sand had ripped them away.  His skin was scored with cuts.

Bleary eyes finally focused.  Grass.  He was in the plains.  They had never looked so vividly golden.  Crisp.  He reached out the touch the soft, feathery grass heads.  Stopped.  His shaking hands were vibrant red.  Looked up.  Cloudless blue skies.  A fiery noon sun.

Dig.  He had to dig.  His trembling fingers hovered over the sand beneath him.  Not there.  Anywhere but there.  He reached for the grass.  Into the rock-hard clay.  His clawing fingers left bloody trails as his skin scraped off.  Blisters bubbled off his hide like boiling water.  Growing and popping.  Too much pain to stay upright.  He collapsed.

Ghostly flesh clumps peeled off and rolled away, becoming tumbleweeds of shed snakeskin.  All he could do was watch as his body changed colors.  Blackening uncovered muscle.  Yellowing tendon, drying, snapping away.  White bone peeking through the gristly mess.

A merciful shadow fell over him.  Thankful, crying, he looked up to see his savor.  A ghostly white figure.  A huge grub.  Thick.  Battle worn.  A bloody red gash in his stomach.  A heart beating in his hand.  Torani whispered, “Not you.  Please, don’t—” the grub fell on him with a wild shriek.

Torani shot up with a strangled scream.  Smashed his forehead against his den’s ceiling.  Fell back.  Curled into himself.  Applied pressure where it hurt.  Swore incessant nonsense.  Panting devolved into coughing until he felt lightheaded from lack of air.

All his dreams had been nightmares lately, but that one took the cake.  What he would have given to bury himself in Serana’s arms right then.  He wanted <i>Serana</i>, right?  And not Vaeilentha?  Yes, of course.  What a ridiculous thing to question.

Stilted breathing eased into its natural rhythm.  When was it?  Maybe noon?  He shivered, remembering the inviting warmth from his dream’s sun.  His skin dissolving under it.  He was done sleeping for today.  Better yet if he never slept again.

Sitting up.  Cradling his head.  He had to tell Errek and Serana about his plan with Vaeilentha.  That they would leave after initiation.  After tonight.  It was a good excuse to go see them.  To not be alone with his thoughts.

He dragged himself out of his den.  Almost stumbled off his landing.  Fell to his knees looking down.  The distance was endless.  Bottomless.  He vomited a miserable, gooey string of bile into the pit.  Drawing back from the edge, he lay on his side.  Maybe leaving the nest to find more places to show Vaeilentha was a better use of his time.  Except the sun was out.  Never mind.

Eventually, the dizziness passed.  He felt too weak to climb to Serana’s den.  Best to start with Errek.  He just had to step off the edge and fall onto the rope bridge—Another wave of nausea.  Okay, step off the edge <i>without looking</i>.  Suddenly, he did not trust his wings to slow the fall.  He hissed an admonishment at himself.  Eyes closed, he opened his wings and hopped off the landing.

As bridge bounced, his legs gave.  He held onto the ropes for dear life.  When it stilled, he eased himself onto his feet.  Walked to the landing.  Followed the spiral down.

He hesitated at the entrance to the hunter’s barracks.  When had he last been here?  He had no memories of it.  Entering, he revised that thought.  He recognized the benches.  Knew the hole-in-the-wall dens would be in the back chamber.

Cautiously, he tiptoed into that space.  Checked one den after another for Errek.  Empty.  Empty.  Wrong hunter.  Empty… There he was.  Near the end.  Curled up with the rising prince.  So.  Vaeilentha was not enough for Kordi?   She had to go after Errek as well!?  Torani eased his breathing to calm himself.

He tapped on Errek’s face.  A nose wriggle as Errek turned away.  Another poke.  The hunter snapped in his sleep, as if warding off a stray fly.  Torani kept prodding.  A sneer formed on Errek’s face, and his eyes shot open.  The start of a growl fizzled out as Errek’s expression shifted to shock and then excitement.

Waving for Errek to follow, Torani stood.  Errek carefully disentangled himself from Kordi.  Despite some grumbling, she stayed asleep.  They continued into the main chamber.  Torani wearily sat on one of the benches.

An instant later, Errek was on top of him, strangling him in a bear hug.  “You… Are you yourself again?  You’re not supposed to be here, so you must be back to normal.  Right!?”

“That is…”  He shifted position.  “Breaking rules was never supposed to define who I was.  Who I <i>am</i>…”

Errek leaned back.  “But it is you, right, Entorani?”

Cringing, “Just Torani.  When it’s you and me.”

The bone crushing resumed.  “<i>It is you</i>.”

“I hope so.  Yeah.”

“What’s that mean?”

“It’s complicated.”

Errek shrugged.  “We’ve got all day.”

“I don’t want to start there.  I uh…”  He cleared his throat.  “I’m sorry I haven’t been around.  That when you came to talk to me, I was—”

“The queen got to you.  It’s fine.  I’ve learned a lot more about how this family works when you’re… when someone like you isn’t intervening.”

“Did something happen?”

“I got my first reward pulses.  Hated them.  Why would I want someone to force me to feel something?  Even if it’s a good something.  Higher family members treat us like prey.”

“Errek—”

“They push us to do things we don’t want.  Tell us to accept it, because eventually we’ll like it.  What a joke!  You know, Kordi told me what happens to princes.  Why there’s no king rank.”

“That—"

“You probably don’t want to hear this, but I am so happy you failed.  Otherwise, you’d be gone!  And where would I be without you?  I don’t fully get what it means that we can die, but—”

Torani covered Errek’s mouth.  “You talk <i>so much</i> now, and I—”  He looked down.  “I can’t handle <i>that</i> right now.  I have too much on my mind already.”

Disappointment played across Errek’s face.  Or maybe rejection.  “No.  I shouldn’t be whining about things that don’t matter.”

“Errek—”

“Not when you just got better.  We can talk about it some other time.  Right?”

“Y-yes.”

“Okay.  So, if there’s a lot on your mind, I guess you need something from me.”

“Yes...”

“What do you need?”

Torani looked away.  “Clearly, you’ve been spending time with Serana.  I mean, you were always bold with your questions, but…”

“Actually, everyone says I’m just like you.  Including Serana.”

A huffed laugh.  “Sorry about that then…”  Torani hoped more banter would come.  Instead, Errek waited for the real conversation.  He had definitely picked up some tricks from Serana.  “We’re leaving after initiation.  Ilen’s going to help us.  When she tries to stake a claim on you, don’t fight it.  It’s to help you leave.”

A frown twitched onto Errek’s face.  “I don’t need her.  If you leave, I’ll follow.  In fact, if you’re ready to go, then let’s get out at sunset.”

“I’m not leaving without Serana, and Zehra is deep in her.  She needs Ilen’s help.”

“You sure?  I bet we could drag her out if we worked together.”

“Trust me.  Working with Ilen is the best option.”

“Okay… So, why is Vaeilentha helping us?”

“She needs more hands to get Kordi and her grubs out.  Then, I’m going to help her set up the new nest.  Once she’s settled, we’ll go somewhere else.  Start over fresh.  Just the three of us.”

Errek turned away, chewing on his lip as his eyes narrowed.

Torani sighed.  “What are you thinking?”

He glanced back.  “You’re going to say no.”

“Ask me anyway.”

“Kordi should stay with us.”

“NO.”  It came out as a growl.

“Told you.”

Torani sighed deeply.  “I failed Ilen.  I can’t betray her by taking my replacement from her.  Kordi won’t want to leave anyway.”

“Kordi doesn’t want to die!”

“Once she reaches prince, nothing will matter more to her than starting the family.  She won’t want to die, but it’s a sacrifice she’ll gladly make.  I didn’t get all the way there, and I’d still die a million times for my family.”

“Why can’t our family be her family?”

“Because if I could start a new nest, I never would have—!”  <i>Settled for you</i>.  Worked to make a surrogate family to fill the gaping void.  And if he ever found a way to have a <i>real family</i>, in the way he was supposed to, he would… be paralyzed by indecision.  “I wouldn’t have been able to see how meaningful it is to be alive for the family I chose.”

“Torani, please!”

“Errek, I can’t do this tonight.”

With a pained grimace, he raked his fingers through his hair.  Stiffly shook his head.

Torani placed his forehead against Errek’s.  “If we have to have this fight, then wait until after we’ve left.  Wait until we know if Kordi would even want it.”

Errek sniffed loudly.  “Okay.  You’re right.  She has to have a say in it.  Otherwise, we’re no better than Vaeilentha and Azehralia.”  He reset his jaw.  “But we’re really leaving?”

“Yes.  All of us.”

“Good.” A relieved huff.  “I’m glad Serana’s not angry at you anymore.  I wasn’t sure I’d like her, but I do.  I was sad when she didn’t—” His eyes locked onto Torani.  Onto that guilty expression.  Errek clicked his tongue.  “You didn’t talk to her yet.”

“Not yet.”

He groaned and stood up.

“Errek—”

“Go.  You’re going to need the rest of the day.  We’ll have all the time in the world after initiation.”

“Wait—”

Glowering with a slouched posture and his hands stuffed into his pockets, Errek looked particularly prickly.

Torani limply held out his arms.  “One more before I go?”

Errek rolled his eyes, but wrapped his arms around Torani again.  When they separated, he added, “Don’t mess this up.  Serana said that once I made knight, we’d be like this—”  He locked his fingers together.  “I don’t want to miss out on that.”

“I won’t leave her behind.”

“Then go.”  Shaking his head, Errek returned to the back chamber.  Torani took a deep breath.  Stood.  Turned around.  Began the terrifying journey to Serana’s den.
