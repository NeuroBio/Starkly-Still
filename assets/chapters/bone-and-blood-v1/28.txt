Almost midnight.  That awful restlessness, the urge to go out and do something—anything!—swept through Entorani.  The family must need him somehow.  Some way to help.  Something to fix.

But no.  That was his old self talking.  The <i>between</i> self.  There was no need to compulsively stay busy.  Instead, he remained in place.  Buried under his feathers.  Like a good prince.  Just as he had done for… He had lost track of how many nights.

Never mind.  There would be work enough for him once Vaeilentha left the nest.  It would only be a few months.  Maybe half a year at worst.  He could wait that long.  No problem.  Everything would be—

A knock on his door.

Entorani buried himself further, begging Errek to go away.  Because who else would it be?  Serana?  No.  She knew better.

More knocking.

Azehralia needed nothing from him.  It would not be Demeko or Rotero.  It could only be Errek.  Why did he refuse to understand that—!?

“I know you’re in there.”  Vaeilentha.

Entorani curled into himself.  <i>She was so much worse than Errek</i>.  What did he do while cloistered in his den to instigate this visit?

Furious pounding on his door.

The sooner he answered her, the sooner she would be gone.  He snaked towards the exit.  Carefully, he cracked the door open.  “Evening, Ilen.”

“About time.”  She pulled on the door, but he held on, keeping it mostly closed.  “Really?”

“What do you need?”

“Soon, one of my grubs will break out of her cocoon.  I want to know what she’ll be.  Unfortunately, that’s your area of expertise.  Get out here.”  She stepped back, motioning for Entorani to come.

Azehralia would want Entorani to keep the peace.  Reluctantly, he exited his den.  Vaeilentha seemed taller.  He realized it was because he was hunched over.  Straightening up, he waited for further orders.

Her mouth kinked into a frown.  “I assume you remember where to go.”

He nodded.

“Then be quick.”  She opened her wings and dove into the pit.

His shoulders slouched.  His change of title had not come with miraculously working wings.  He eased onto the wall and sluggishly descended.  Stepped onto the spiral.  Drifted along it.

A commotion above him.  Two hunters shoved Ru back and forth between them.  In another lifetime, Entorani might have intervened.  He knew better now.  They would figure it out.

Reaching the new lower walkway, Entorani scanned for workers.  He saw none.  Nor did he hear them.  They must have finished the new cocooning dens.  Just in time for initiation.  Good for them.  He opened a hatch and climbed into the ascension layer.  A sharp whistle to his left.  Vaeilentha sat impatiently on a rock at the entrance to one of the dens.  He forced himself to hurry over.

“I see you’re taking your sweet time tonight.”

He shrugged as he passed her.  Reached the back of the den.  Kneeled before the still, milky white crescent.  Stared at it in confusion.  “Your grub isn’t close to ready.”

“I’m well aware, Torani.”

His posture drooped further.  “Is there any point in correcting you?”

“About what, knight-un-prince?”

“I didn’t think so.”

Vaeilentha stepped towards him.  “It was <i>my</i> privilege to name you.  Not hers.”

“Take it up with Zehra then.”

“Oh, I did.  I threw a most marvelous fit for her benefit.  It’s given me ample excuse to sulk in my tunnels.   Plenty of alone time.  I didn’t put much stock into your plan, but I’ll concede: you were right.  I do feel different now.  Untethered.  I’m tempted to test my limits.  To walk out the exit just to prove I can do it.  But I don’t engage in pointless risks.”

“Ilen, stop going against Zehra.  It’s for the best.”

“She really got into your head, didn’t she?”

“If you want to know what your grub is, I’ll tell you.  Otherwise, we have nothing more to discuss.”

She shrugged.  “All right.  Sure.  Tell me.”

Shaking his head, Entorani turned back to the cocoon.  He ran a hand along its length.  Soon, he found a place where the grub was near the edge.  Where he could key into its electrical system.  He felt its pulse.  Sat back.  Sighed.  “You’re lucky.”

“What?”  Her posture stiffened.  “What does that mean?!”

“She’s a knight.”  Entorani expected her to be happy.  Instead, she looked horrified.  Frustrated.  Desperate.  “Isn’t this what you wanted?”

“It… complicates things.”

“Meaning?”

“I thought they would be hunters at best.  And, let’s be honest, since you already got the dud royal, I expected them to be workers.  I was ready to leave them behind!  My first brood could be fully ascended before her sick grubs reached worker.  But a knight?!  An honest royal?!  How can leave that behind?”

“Are we back to <i>this</i> conversation?”

Vaeilentha sneered, ready to launch into a barrage of insults.  Instead, she sucked in her breath through grit teeth and eased back.  “So, tell me, Torani.  If you’re such a <i>good boy</i> now, why haven’t you told the queen about our plan?”

“T-that’s…”

“Her hold on you isn’t really all that strong, is it?”  She circled around him.  “You still care more about your sorry hide than this family.”

“That’s not true!  I just don’t see any point in telling her.  Your resistance is futile.”

“Wrong answer.  The truth is you know you’re still mine.  One little burst of pheromones isn’t enough to undo that.”

Shooting to his feet, “You are <i>nothing</i> compared to her.”

She stopped in front of him.  “Do you miss your rejects?”

Entorani cringed.

“You do.  She couldn’t even erase that.  Pathetic.  With me you can have them, remember?  That was our deal.  Do you still want them?”

No.  He had all of Azehralia’s family now.  There was no reason to limit himself to just Serana and Errek.  Azehralia would get better.  The nest would get better.  Everyone would be happier this way.

Even if he knew Serana was miserable.  And that Errek would only be in more danger the further he ascended.  That Azehralia might turn Errek against Entorani.  Or, even worse, send him away.  That every night of Entorani’s remaining existence would be meaningless and purposeless.  That he would never truly feel like a prince.

“It doesn’t matter if I want it!  You can’t do anything about it!  Even now, I feel Zehra like she’s next to me.  She’s in my dreams.  My every thought is focused on <i>her</i>.  You can’t change that!”

“Oh, darling, you have no idea what I can do.  You want your rejects?  Then come here.”  She held her arms wide open.

Entorani stumbled back.  Glanced at the exit.  Just leave.  His place was out there.  An entire nest.  His only chance to ever be considered a prince.  To be seen as the thing he wanted to be.  The thing he was not.  The thing that came at the cost of his real family.

He looked back at Vaeilentha.  She stayed in place.  No pulses.  No pheromones.  Nothing.  It was his choice to make.  He wished she would use her entire arsenal against him.  Wanted to blame her for this decision.  Tentatively, he stepped closer to her.

She cupped his face in her hands.  “I knew she could never take you from me.  Let’s put you back the way you’re supposed to be.”

Her pheromones hit him like a brick wall.  He choked.  Dropped to his knees.  Lost track of Azehralia’s scent.  Saw and felt nothing but Vaeilentha.  His connection with her system was beyond reward pulses.  He was a piece of her.  Together, <i>they</i> were complete.

As she kneeled to join him, and he threw his arms around her.  He gave a dizzy laugh.  Azehralia’s claim on him had been pathetic.  A feeble mockery of what he had with Vaeilentha now.  What they had always had.  When he was a knight, a hunter, when his first syllable was changed to Ran—wait.  Had that happened?  Never mind, it made no difference now.

“Ilen.  <i>My</i> <i>Ilen</i>.”  His princess.  His future nest.  The whole point of his being.  She was why he existed.

All bitterness and hatred drifted away.  It was not her fault he failed her.  Not her fault that she reached her full potential.  Not her fault that she moved on.  Even though he knew it had to be like this, he never wanted to let her go.  “Ilen, I’m sorry.  I’m so, so sorry.”

“I know.”

“I was willing to die for you.”  His nails dug deeper into her skin.  “If it would have accomplished anything, I would have done it!  But it wasn’t going to.  It wouldn’t fix <i>anything</i>!”

She shushed him.  “<i>I know</i>.  I told you before: this was a cruel joke played on both of us.  But we can still make the best of it.  At least as long as we accept reality.  Do you know what that means?”

His grip on her slackened.  He leaned away.  “Yeah.”

“Then what’s your name?”

“Torani.  Just Torani.”

Through a snarl, “And the only time you will <i>ever</i> accept a fourth syllable is if I call you <i>my</i> Torani.”

He pulled her into him.  Into a kiss.  That possessiveness in her anger.  Where had <i>that</i> been for that last year?  Astonishing that she allowed this now.  That she clung onto him as desperately as he clung to her.  Apparently, he was not the only one still holding onto what they had.  This was the peace he needed.

Resting his head on her shoulder, he heaved a sigh of relief.  His anxious laugh broke the silence.  “Why do I feel better when you just took away the thing I wanted so badly?”

“Because I released you from a lie.  That title didn’t give you a place, it took you from it!  It was a shackle!  Now, you’re free of that burden.”

“This doesn’t feel like freedom.”

“The fact that you can say that, proves you have more freedom than you deserve.”  She pushed him away and crossed her arms.  Huffed.  Uncrossed them.  “Will you still be able to leave me when the time comes?  Or will I have to kill you?”

“This won’t last.”  Those words brought tears to his eyes.  No.  He had already been crying.  He wiped his face clean.  “Errek and Serana will always need me.  <i>That’s</i> my place.  They’re my family.  I’ll always pick them in the end.”

“Good.”

“But I’ll do everything in my power to help you.  I won’t fail you a—”

“Stop!”  She slapped hand over his mouth.  “It’s hard enough to deal with you when you hate me.  Don’t start liking me again.”

Pushing her hand away, “It’s not about hate, or like, or love.  It’s about doing right by you.”

“Shut.  The hell.  Up.”

“Sorry.”  Kordi not living up to your standards then?  Still bothered by feelings for the trash you threw away?  <i>What a shame</i>.  Exhaling jaggedly, he let those feelings go.  “We’re still going with my plan?”

“I wouldn’t have subjected myself to this otherwise.”  She pointed at the cocoon.  “But we’re not waiting for them to ascend.  We’re taking them as is.”  She held up a finger before Torani could protest.  “I’m willing to risk it.”

“Okay.  So.  When?”

“After initiation.  Azehralia will be weak.  Off guard.  Unable to respond even if we royally fuck up.  I assume you know where my new nest will be?”

“I have some ideas.”

“Close enough.  In the meantime, be a good prince.  Azehralia can’t know what I’ve done.  I may be stronger than her, but she raised me.  I have no doubt that there are ways she can retaliate that I can’t defend against.”  She rose to her feet.  Took a deep breath.  Her usual biting charm returned to her tone.  “So, <i>Prince En-</i>Torani.  Follow me.  I want to know what my other grub is.”
