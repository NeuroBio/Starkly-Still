Entorani spent the rest of the night in his den.  Out of the way.  Out of trouble.  Out of fight.

He felt Azehralia’s presence as strongly as if she was buried under the feathers with him.  To think he had believed she was dying.  Or even weakening.  No.  Not his queen.  She was just overworking herself.  After the next brood, everything would go back to normal.  The normal he had never experienced.

Until then, he would ignore the rising anxiety.  Forget that he knew she lied to the family when it suited her.  Silence all his doubts, uncertainties, and nightmares.  Just focus on her scent.  On his title.  His place.  His family.

Or rather, the queen’s family.  Which was also his family.  Except where did Errek fit into that?  A question to worry about later.  Or never.  What difference did it make?  He finally had what he wanted.  What he deserved.  A family to look after until Azehralia died, and then—

No!  There was no “and then.”  She would not die.  She was perfectly healthy.  Just a little tired.  As soon as she had time to rest—

A metal hinge whimpered.  His door opening.  <i>Serana</i>.

Entorani squirmed deeper, flattening himself against the bare rock.  He mentally begged Serana to turn back around.  Return to her own den.  The weight above him increased.

“Rani?”

Maybe if he was still enough, Serana would think he was not there.  Maybe she would leave.  Maybe he would not have to—She dug into the feathers, throwing them aside.  Her hands scraped across his chest.

“There you are.”  She cleared away fluff until she revealed his face.  “Are you sulking?"

“You can’t be in here.”

“Get over it.  We’re celebrating.  You’re still alive!  I was sure you were done for.  I’ve never felt her get that angry.  But you were right.  Somehow, you got away—”

Entorani shoved Serana back.  Squirmed out from underneath her.  “I didn’t get away with anyway.  You need to leave.”

Serana crossed her arms.  “The queen’s pheromones really did a number on you, huh?  Come on, shake it off.  It’s not like you were the only one who got a dose of it.”  Her tone bittered.  “Or did you not hear the screaming?”

“I did.”

“Thanks for siccing her on me, by the way.”

“You got off with a slap on the wrist.  She blamed me for pushing you out of line.”

“Yeah, common theme…”  She crossed her arms.  “I still got screamed at.”

“Apparently, it wasn’t very effective.”

“What?”

“She ordered you to stay away from me.  But you’re here.  Still stepping out of place.”

“That’s… what we do?”

“That’s what <i>you</i> do.  I’m done with it.  It’s about time I started acting my rank.”

“Your what?  Oh, come off it, Rani.  If it wasn’t for baby duck—”

“Stop calling me that!”

“Excuse you?”

“My name is <i>Prince Entorani</i>.  I expect you to use every syllable.”

Serana looked conflicted on whether to laugh and tell him he was full of shit or to take him at his word.  He could still play it off as a bad a joke.  He could undo the damage before it was done.

He hissed, “I mean it.”

She eased back.  “P-prince then.”

He stared at the wall.  “You have no place here, knight.  The game we played is over.  I’m no longer in a position to entertain your fancy.”

“My—!?  After you and your—?!”

As Entorani opened his mouth, she caught herself.  He knew he should reprimand her.  It was what the queen would have wanted.  His bottom jaw quivered with unspoken admonishments.

Serana’s tone transitioned to neutral coolness.  “All right.  I understand.  I see what you did to keep your skin.”

“For a knight, you talk too much.”

Monotone.  “Understood.  <i>Prince</i>.”

“Thank you.  You’re dismissed.”  His gaze never left the wall.  He flinched when his door clicked closed.  Holding his breath, he listened to the scraping as Serana climbed to her own den.  Her door shutting.  His shuddering whimper broke the silence.

“Dammit.  Dammitdammitdammit.  Why?  Why?  WHY!?”  He dug his fingers into his skull as a shuddering breath escaped him.  “She doesn’t need me.  She’s safer this way.  She’ll be okay.  She doesn’t need… <i>me</i>.”

And he would make sure he did not need her.  Azehralia would have been proud of him for resisting that temptation.  For being a good prince.  For doing what was <i>best for the family</i>.  Entorani laughed bitterly.
