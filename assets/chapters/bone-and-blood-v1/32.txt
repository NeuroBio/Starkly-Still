Torani had never been in a knight’s den before.  Vaeilentha had carved out his special prince den.  He had moved into it before he reached knight.   Strange how different this space was.

A single-chamber room tall enough to walk into.  Beyond the narrow entryway, a rock bench stood by the right-side wall.  Divots on the left side acted as an organizer, housing spare clothes and Serana’s medical supplies.  The bed was cut into the back wall.  A gently curving rock slab similar to the platforms in the cocooning dens.  Serana lay there, arms crossed and expression neutral.  The most stoic he had ever seen her.

Perhaps it was best to leave her like that.  To just sit and watch.  That is what a coward would do.  And Torani was definitely a coward.  He leaned against the wall.

If Serana remained ignorant to the plan and Vaeilentha tried to make a claim on her, all hell would break loose.  Even if the princess handled the situation, deep down, Serana would be terrified.  Or furious.  Or both.  Torani would never put her through that.

He kneeled next to her bed.  His hand hovered over her.  Fighting the last excuses to not face her wrath, he tapped on her shoulder.  Her hand shot up.  Death grip around his wrist.  A low growl rumbled from her semi-conscious body.

“Rana, it’s me.”

“What?”  A groan as she blinked furiously.  Her unfocused eyes drifted to his.  Her expression hardened.  “What, prince?”

“N-not prince.  Rani.”

A blank stare.  She slowly rose to sitting position.  Rubbed at her eyes.  Cracked a kink in her neck.  “So… you’re not here on business from the queen.”

“No.”

“You’re not supposed to be here at all.”

“No.”

“Good.”  She launched at him.  Pinned him to the ground.  Swiped at his face.  Torani squirmed to avoid her attacks.  Saw an opening.  Shoved her back.  Scooted into the den’s front wall.  Serana stayed in place, poised to leap.  “Get.  Out.”

“Rana, I—”

“Don’t call me that!  Get your fucking hide out of here!”

“You know I didn’t mean what I said before!  Right!?  Zehra was—!”

“You are so full of shit!”

“I didn’t have a choice before!”

“Oh, and suddenly you do now!?”

“S-sort of?”

“GET.  OUT.”

“Just—Listen—Ilen—!”  Serana’s posture tightened.  About to pounce.  Torani choked it out: “Ilen took me back!”

Rage to confusion to disgust.  Serana’s mouth quivered but no words came out.

“She doesn’t care how I act.  She doesn’t what I do with you.  So, this is me.  Not <i>Prince Entorani</i>.  I’m screwed up, stuck in nowhere space Torani.  A knight who can’t be a prince and doesn’t know how to be a knight.  Me.  And what <I>I</I> want is to apologize.”

Serana buried her face in her hands.  “Torani, what the fuck?”  At least she used his knight’s name.  Progress?  She threw her hands down.  “How do you manage to keep making even worse decisions?!”

“Does it make a difference at this point?”

“I guess not.”  She leaned against her bed to stare at the ceiling.  A shrug as she shook her head.  “The apology you didn’t give is not accepted, by the way.”

“<i>I am sorry</i>.  I hated everything I said to you.  But it’s what Zehra wanted.”

“Oh, so she was hiding under you and whispering into your ear?”

“Is that what happens when you’re acting on queen’s will?”

“Not the same thing.”

“It’s the exact same thing.”  She shot him a dirty look.  He wilted.  “Okay, don’t forgive me.  I haven’t earned it.  But will you give me a chance to earn it?”

Dead stare.  “You didn’t come here to apologize.  You’re here because you’re digging an even deeper hole.  And you want me to throw myself in it.  That sound about right?”

“You want the truth?”

“Always.”

“I’m here because I’m having horrific nightmares about failing everyone I care about.”  A huff of self-deprecating laughter.  “And that’s my reality right now too, isn’t it?”

“You’re not wrong.”

A deep breath.  “Do you want to know why I let Ilen take me back?”

“You had a <i>choice</i>?”

“Yeah.  I did.”

“So, you can choose to commit unfathomable treason against the queen for the princess.  But when I’m involved—”

“<i>Ilen raised me</i>.  I can always choose her over the queen.”

“Sounds to me like you’ve always been able to pick and choose when to obey.”

“ONLY WHEN ILEN AND ZEHRA DISAGREE!”  Torani ran his hands through his hair.  “Just listen!  Ilen doesn’t want me.  She wants my help.  Once she’s done with me, she’ll dump me like trash.  Again.  But this time, I got a say in it.  She will help you leave and then let you go.  We can start over.  You, Me, and Errek.  <i>Do you want that</i>?”

“You and your pretty dreams.”

“It’s not a dream anymore.  I’m leaving.  Errek is coming.  We’re starting over.  Please come with us.”

She looked away.  “If you’ve already decided on it, then I guess I don’t have a choice.”

“<i>Yes, you do</i>.”  He crawled closer to her.  “If you don’t want this, freedom, a bed of feathers, a view of the sky…”  Dropping to a whisper, “<i>Me</i>.  Then I’ll tell Ilen to leave you here.  Is that what you want?”

“Okay, I’ll call your bluff.  I don’t want to go.”

“This isn’t a bluff!  If that’s your real answer, then I’ll do what you want!”

“It’s my real answer.”  She nonchalantly regarded her nails.

He stood.  “Okay.  I’ll tell Ilen the next chance I get.”  Dizzy, he ambled towards the exit.  His hand reached for the door knob.

“Do you really mean it?  You would let me stay?”

“Yes, Rana.  I mean it.”  He rested his forehead against the door.  That spark of hope that Serana’s real answer would be different caused more pain than relief.  “I’m me again.  I care about you.  I don’t want to leave you behind.  But I refuse to force you to come with me.  It would make you hate me.”  He turned around.  “I wouldn’t be able to live myself.”

“It’s a <i>real</i> choice?”

“How many times do I have to say it!?”

She ignored his outburst.  Her brow furrowed then raised in thought.  “I don’t think I’ve ever made a real decision before.  I mean, sure, I choose how I do things, but not what or why.  The so-called ‘decision’ is obey or disobey.  Reward or punishment.  Though… is this different?  Maintain loyalty to the queen or betray it…”

“To put it in those terms… one’s reward is stability.  The other’s is freedom.  Both choices have something to gain and something you’ll have to give up.”

“And whatever I say, yes or no, you’ll <i>really</i> listen?”

Torani wanted to yank his hair out.  A note of fear in her tone kept him externally composed.  “<i>Yes</i>.”

Serana shifted uncomfortably.  Her gaze darted around the small chamber.  Her smile kinked sharply up as if she planned to make a sarcastic remark.  It faded.  “Just do what you want.”

“That’s not—The point is to do what <i>you</i> want.”

“<I>I</I> want you to do what <i>you</i> want.”

Torani crossed his arms.  “Does that mean you want to come?”

“If that’s what you want.”

“No.  I want you to make your own decision.”

“I DON’T!”

“Why not?!”

“Don’t you get it?  This isn’t fair!”

“’Fair?’  I don’t understand… At all.”

“This isn’t about ‘stability’ or ‘freedom.’  This is about whether I stupidly go with you when I know you’ll hurt me!  If I don’t choose, then it’s not my fault when you push me aside.  Again!”

“It’s not your fault if I hurt you.”

“It’s my fault for giving you another chance to do it!”

“No, it’s my fault for not deserving that chance!”  He stormed to her and dropped to his knees.  “I know I messed up.  But this whole place is messed up.  If I get away and still can’t treat you right, then eat me.  I don’t deserve any better.  But this is my chance to be my best for you.  To give you everything you wanted and more.  I know I haven’t earned your trust back, but I don’t have the time to.  Can you take one last blind leap with an idiot who doesn’t always do a good job of showing how much he loves you?”

“You’re definitely an idiot.”  She sighed.  “Why did it have to be you I have feelings for?  It would so much easier if it was, I don’t know, Demeko.”

“Can you imagine how uncomfortable that would make him?”

She snorted.  “He would lose his little mind.  He would want to report me to the queen, but wouldn’t be able to say the words.”  Her fingers traced a circle on the ground.  “Rani, you know I want to go with you.  I want it to work out.  I guess that’s <i>my</i> dream.  Can you make it real?”

“Do you think a coward like me would face you if I didn’t think we had a shot?”

“Probably not.”  A ragged exhale.  “Okay.  I’ll do the stupid thing…”  Her posture stiffened.  “But if you hurt me again, I will eat you alive.  Not joking.”

“I think Errek will help you with that…”

“That one’s got real snake potential.”

“What?”

“Never mind.”  A rough shove.  “You got your answer.  Now, get back to your den, you treasonous git.”

“Can I ask for something else unreasonable?”

“It’s kind of your thing.”  She frowned.  “You want to sleep here, don’t you?”

“If you’ll let me.”

Tilting her head from side-to-side, “Your feathers are better than this rock, you know.”

“I would sleep on thorns if it meant I could be near you.”

“Ew.  Don’t be so gushy.  Anyway, I’d rather sleep in your den.”

“I don’t want to go back into that suffocating hole.”

“Dramatic, are we?”

“I don’t sleep there anymore.  I just have nightmares.  It feels safe here.  Please.”

A grumbled moan.  “All right, fine.”  She laid back on her bed and rolled away from Torani to make space.  Tentatively, he lay down beside her.  She wriggled back into him.  “Just remember: one more wrong move, and you’re dinner.”

He buried his face in her hair.  “Noted.”
